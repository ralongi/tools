- configure client and server
    - static IP on iface
    - static VLAN on iface
    - static bridge IP address?
    - vnet assigned to ovs bridge

create Task 1 to configure settings on client/server
utilize Jeff Bastian's beaker task for power cycling a machine (Task 2)
create Task 3 to check uptime and verify that expected settings are present

hence, create beaker job with these tasks sequentially (standalone):
- Distribution/install
- Task 1 (configure)
- Task 2 (Jeff B's power cycle routine)
- Task 3 (verify configuration after machine under test has come back up
