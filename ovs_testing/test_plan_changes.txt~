MCAST SNOOPING

Test Description:
Steps:
1. Configuration (single bare metal host with hypervisor):
   - Create three VMs on a single bare metal host (iperf installed on all VMs).  All VM guests connected to a single OVS bridge
2. Add a multicast route to each VM: "/sbin/route -n add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev $iface_vm". Verify that it is now reported in routing table on each VM: "/sbin/route -n | grep 224"	
3. Disable mcast_snooping on OVS bridge: "ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr mcast_snooping_enable=false"
4. Start iperf mcast server on VM1: "iperf -s -u -B 224.0.55.55 -i 1 -p $iface_vm &".  Using tcpdump verify that mcast traffic is received on VM2 and VM3: "tcpdump -nn -i $iface_vm ip multicast"
5. Enable mcast_snooping on OVS bridge: "ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr mcast_snooping_enable=true"
6. Restart iperf mcast server on VM1: "pkill iperf"; "iperf -s -u -B 224.0.55.55 -i 1 -p $iface_vm &".  Using tcpdump verify that mcast traffic is NOT received on VM2 and VM3: "tcpdump -nn -i $iface_vm ip multicast"
7. Restart iperf mcast server on VM1: "pkill iperf"; "iperf -s -u -B 224.0.55.55 -i 1 -p $iface_vm &", Launch iperf mcast client on VM2 and VM3: "iperf -c 224.0.55.55 -u -T 32 -t 3 -i 1 -p $iface_vm &".  Using tcpdump, verify that mcast traffic is now seen on VM2 and VM3: "tcpdump -nn -i $iface_vm ip multicast"

Expected Results:
1. Configuration is successful
2. Multicast route is successfully added on each VM
3. Command to disable multicast snooping executes successfully
4. IP Multicast traffic is observed on VM2 and VM3
5. Command to enable multicast snooping executes successfully
6. No mcast traffic is observed on VM2 or VM3
7. Mcast traffic is observed on VM2 or VM3

SPANNING TREE

Test Description (STP):
Steps:
1. Configuration (single bare metal host):
   - Create two OVS bridges
   - Add intport to each OVS bridge
   - Create two network name spaces
   - Configure two veth pairs, use them to create redundant links between the two OVS bridges
   - Assign one intport to one ns, one to the other ns, assign IP addresses to both intports on same IP subnet
   - Disable STP: ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr0 stp_enable=false, ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr1 stp_enable=false
   - Set all interfaces up
2. Check for a network storm on all veth interfaces by running tcpdump and confirming that there are excessive packets captured
3. Execute a ping test between intports
4. Enable STP: ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr0 stp_enable=true, ovs-vsctl set Bridge $ovsbr1 stp_enable=true; wait 50 seconds for network convergence
5. Check for the presence of 802.1d BPDU's on all veth interfaces
6. Execute a ping test between intports
7. Disable forwarding port on non-root bridge, wait 50 seconds for network convergence
8. Execute a ping test between intports, verify that packets are traversing the new forwarding port
9. Increase path cost on inactive path to ensure that it remains inactive path after being added back to bridge.  Re-enable port that was disabled in Step 7, wait 50 seconds for network convergence
10. Execute a ping test between intports, verify pings are successful and are traversing the correct path
11. Check for a network storm on all veth interfaces by running tcpdump and confirming that there are no excessive packets captured

Expected Results:
1. Configuration is successful
2. A network storm is present
3. The pings are NOT successful
4. STP is successfully enabled
5. 802.1d BPDU's are observed on all veth interfaces
6. The pings are successful
7. The current forwarding port on the non-root bridge is successfully disabled
8. The pings are successful and are traversing the new forwarding port on the non-root bridge
9. The newly added port does not go into Forwarding state
10. The pings are successful and are still traversing the new forwarding port on the non-root bridge
11. No network storm is present
