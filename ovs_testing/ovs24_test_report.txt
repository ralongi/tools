OVS 2.4.0 Test Observations:

Throughput:

cxgb4 (40G): 
- Much impreoved when MTU=9000, especially for tunnels (even though driver doesn't support vxlan offload)

mlx4_en (40G):
- IPv6 tests over vxlan tunnels failing
- Tunnel tests only yield 5 Gbps (except for vxlan without vlan, which is much higher).  Is this expected with 40G card?
