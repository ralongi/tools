# steps to do basic test of multicast snooping

install and start ovs
create ovs bridge with internal port
create 2 or 3 VMs connected to the ovs bridge, start VMs, update to same kernel that's running on host
configure IP addresses on eth0 on all VMs such that they can connect to host intport (can be static or not)
add multicast route to all VMs (/sbin/route -n add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0)
verify that the multicast route has been successfully added (/sbin/route -n | grep 224)
make sure multicast snooping is disabled on OVS bridge (ovs-vsctl set Bridge myovs mcast_snooping_enable=false)
make sure command was successful
launch multicast server on VM1 (iperf -s -u -B 224.0.55.55 -i 1 -p eth0)
verify that multicast packets/traffic are observed on eth0 of VM2 and VM3 (tcpdump -nn -i eth0 ip multicast > output.asc; grep <mcast string> or check stats somewhere)
pkill iperf server on VM1; make sure it is successfully killed
enable multicast snooping (ovs-vsctl set Bridge myovs mcast_snooping_enable=true)
make sure command was successful
launch multicast server on VM1 (iperf -s -u -B 224.0.55.55 -i 1 -p eth0)
verify that no multicast packets are observed on eth0 of VM2 and VM3 (tcpdump -nn -i eth0 ip multicast > output.asc; grep <mcast string> or check stats somewhere)
launch multicast client app using iperf on VM2 and VM3 (iperf -c 224.0.55.55 -u -T 32 -t 3 -i 1 -p eth0)
verify that multicast traffic is now passed on VM2 and VM2 eth0 (tcpdump -nn -i eth0 ip multicast > output.asc; grep <mcast string> or check stats somewhere)
verify that the multicast server received the traffic from clients??
repeat steps??
test other ovs-vsctl multicast_snooping related commands??
