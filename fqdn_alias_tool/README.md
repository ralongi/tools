This is a tool to create permanent DNS aliases on a system to save the time of having to enter the entire FQDN of a system.

The tool must be run as root due to the need to write to /etc.

The user needs to populate the file "host_list.txt" withbn the DNS aliases they want (a sample entry is provided).
